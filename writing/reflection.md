## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool
MARTIN, Marcel. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads. EMBnet.journal, [S.l.], v. 17, n. 1, p. pp. 10-12, may 2011. ISSN 2226-6089

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
The tool is used for better understanding of high-thoughtput sequencing reads. With this information one would be able to analyze DNA by comparing understood DNA with some which may be unknown to grasp more information.  

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
To my understanding this tool addresses sequence adapters which are short DNA sequences which are used to understand generally unknown sequences of DNA. The tool removes and trims these adapter sequences among other sections which my be unwanted in the data being used. It reads from the small-RNA sequencing which has 3' sequencing adapter since the read is longer than the molecule sequenced. I gathered that the 3' was used because both 3' and 5' have bar-coding sequences among other important pieces of information. By trimming and modifying the adapter/primer sequences in an error-tolerant way allows one to remove any extraneous sections of data which may be detrimental to better understanding the data available.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 By considering the amount of information that is necessary to depict even portions of DNA one would need a way to take it all in. With this tool one is able to lower the amount of data that is needed to work with DNA increasing the amount of information that is able to be gathered in the same amount of time.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 Although the tool is able to trim unnecessary pieces data to be able to focus more on what area is being address, this may lead to missing information. If one were to removed any section of information from a set of data it will no longer represent the same information. As such, the information extrapolated my not be applicable to similar research if not irrelevant.


### Second Tool

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 From what I understood, this tool is where genome data is stored. With this kind of data available to just about everyone allows for many kinds of research in genetics to take place. However, this tool provides a huge amount of information at first glance which is quite overwhelming.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 The tool allows researchers to find information on different kinds of genes. For example, it provides information on how long the base pairs are and the very structure of the gene. Using the genome browser one is able to go through the start and end of the gene by sections to get a better understanding of particular section down to the codons.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This tool has quite a few different kinds of applications but I would like to argue that it was developed for people to be able to get some practice on breaking down the genome assembly.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 This tool has the genes of many different sources and are essentially composite genomes. As such it is not a great source of information for research but it would be an excellent place to build a foundation to better understand genomes.
