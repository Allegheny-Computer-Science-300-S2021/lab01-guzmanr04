## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool
MARTIN, Marcel. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads. EMBnet.journal, [S.l.], v. 17, n. 1, p. pp. 10-12, may 2011. ISSN 2226-6089

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
The tool is used for better understanding of high-thoughtput sequencing reads. With this information one would be able to analyze DNA by comparing understood DNA with some which may be unknown to grasp more information.  

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
To my understanding this tool addresses sequence adapters which are short DNA sequences which are used to understand generally unknown sequences of DNA. The tool removes and trims these adapter sequences among other sections which my be unwanted in the data being used. It reads from the small-RNA sequencing which has 3' sequencing adapter since the read is longer than the molecule sequenced. I gathered that the 3' was used because both 3' and 5' have bar-coding sequences among other important pieces of information. By trimming and modifying the adapter/primer sequences in an error-tolerant way allows one to remove any extraneous sections of data which may be detrimental to better understanding the data available.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 By considering the amount of information that is necessary to depict even portions of DNA one would need a way to take it all in. With this tool one is able to lower the amount of data that is needed to work with DNA increasing the amount of information that is able to be gathered in the same amount of time.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 Although the tool is able to trim unnecessary pieces data to be able to focus more on what area is being address, this may lead to missing information. If one were to removed any section of information from a set of data it will no longer represent the same information. As such, the information extrapolated my not be applicable to similar research if not irrelevant.
